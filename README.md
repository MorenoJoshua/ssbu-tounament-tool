## Rules

### Singles
- Ruleset: 3 Stock
- Time Limit: 7 minutes
- All items are turned off.
- Stage Hazard Toggle: Off
- Final Smash Meter: Off
Mii Fighters and their respective custom moves are allowed. If they do use custom moves, it will be shown in their name with what number move it is.
- Similar to previous Smash titles, if time runs out, the winner is first determined by how many - stocks remain, and then by the percentage after time is up.
- If both stock and percentage are the same, or a game ends in both players losing their last stock at the same time, then a tiebreaker is played, which consists of 1 stock and 3 minute match with - the same characters and the same stage.

### Doubles
All the rulesets for singles above apply.
- Team Attack: On

## Stages
Since the competitive scene is still rather young, and because of the number of stages and the option to turn off stage hazards, there is no set stage list. When the losing player is choosing a counterpick stage, the winning player is allowed to ban two stages they have not counterpicked to or won on in the set. The list compiled below is an estimate based off of tournaments up to Ultimate Nimbus.

### Universal starters
The following five stages are on the starter lists of virtually all tournaments:

- Final Destination
- Battlefield
- Smashville
- Town and City
- Pokémon Stadium 2*

### Common starter/Universal counterpick
- Lylat Cruise
- Kalos Pokémon League

### Universal counterpicks/Uncommon starter
- Yoshi's Island
- Yoshi's Story
- Unova Pokémon League

Most Battlefield and Ω forms are allowed, with the exception of the following because they manipulate the Z-axis:

- Dream Land GB
- Flat Zone X
- Hanenbow
- Super Mario Maker
- Mute City SNES
- Pac-Land
Duck Hunt
- Windy Hill Zone is also banned, as the tall grass gives advantages to Snake's and Isabelle's down specials. Some tournaments also choose to ban Fountain of Dreams and its alternate forms due to framerate issues. Garreg Mach Monastery has also been banned because of its alternate forms having lower ceiling blast zones.
